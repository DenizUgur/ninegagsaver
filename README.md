*9GAG Saver, you can finally save gags with title.*

It will provide you to save 9GAG photos with their titles in your gallery. You could share or save it by simply pressing the corresponding button which appears at the right bottom corner of the photo you choose. It also brings comments and like counts. You can also personalize the view of the main screen from the settings.

Versioning
----------------
For transparency in a release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, a project should be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we should adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and constructed with the following guidelines:
- Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major while resetting minor and patch
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor while resetting the patch
- Bug fixes and misc changes bumps only the patch
